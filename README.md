# Binary Search Tree Implementation in Haskell

An implementation of a binary search tree using encapsulated in a dictionary data structure that was driven by a test-first methodology and written in Haskell using the functional programming paradigm. 
This project taught me various testing techniques such as unit testing, debugging, recursive programming, higher-order functions and about data structures.
